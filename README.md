# WeatherAppLC

Weather App Project for LCI

Really taking the "anything you like" criteria liberally on this project. Through everything implemented, I am showcasing my current ability and 
understanding of Android application development. 

I saw opportunities to do things differently amply throughout the project, however the path chosen was the path I felt most comfortable completing successfully. 
Thanks for taking the time to look it over, please reach out with any questions.

I primarily used my Pixel 5 as the test device instead of the AVD. I then tested it for UI issues on an AVD Pixel 3 and Pixel 4XL afterwards.
